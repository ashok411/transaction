When you use the `@EnableTransactionManagement` annotation in a Spring Boot application, it enables Spring's transaction management features
 for the application. This annotation is typically used in the main configuration class, annotated with `@Configuration`.

Transaction management is a critical aspect of many applications, especially those dealing with databases and other resources
 where data consistency is crucial. Transactions help ensure that a group of related database operations either succeed together or fail together,
  ensuring data integrity.

By using the `@EnableTransactionManagement` annotation, you enable Spring's ability to manage transactions declaratively using annotations.
 When you use this annotation, Spring will create a proxy that intercepts the method calls and automatically starts and commits
  or rolls back transactions as needed based on the configured rules.

Key points to understand when using `@EnableTransactionManagement`:

1. **Declarative Transaction Management**: Spring provides two types of transaction management: programmatic and declarative.
With `@EnableTransactionManagement`, you are opting for declarative transaction management. This means you can use annotations like
`@Transactional` to mark methods or classes for transactional behavior, and Spring will take care of starting and committing or rolling back
 transactions for you.

2. **Transactional Behavior**: When you annotate a method or class with `@Transactional`, Spring will wrap that method with transactional behavior.
If an exception is thrown from within the transactional method, the transaction will be rolled back; otherwise, it will be committed.

3. **Transaction Propagation**: You can specify the propagation behavior of transactions using the `propagation` attribute of the `@Transactional`
 annotation. Propagation defines how transactions behave when they interact with other transactions.

4. **Isolation Level**: The `isolation` attribute of the `@Transactional` annotation allows you to specify the isolation level for transactions.
 Isolation levels control the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other concurrent transactions.

5. **Rollback Rules**: You can define custom rollback rules using the `rollbackFor` and `noRollbackFor`
 attributes of the `@Transactional` annotation. These attributes allow you to specify exceptions that trigger a rollback or
  exceptions that do not cause a rollback.

6. **Transaction Management Configuration**: Behind the scenes, Spring will create a transaction manager that will handle the actual transaction
 operations. You need to configure the transaction manager bean in your Spring Boot application context.

Overall, `@EnableTransactionManagement` is a powerful feature that simplifies transaction handling in Spring applications.
It helps to keep your code cleaner and more focused on business logic, as Spring takes care of the underlying transactional concerns.
