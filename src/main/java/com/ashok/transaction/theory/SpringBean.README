In Spring, a "bean" is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Beans are created,
configured, and managed by the container, and they can be retrieved and used in various parts of your application.

When I mentioned "For each bean" in the context of `@EnableTransactionManagement`, I meant that Spring looks for and processes
 transaction-related annotations (such as `@Transactional`) on each bean that is present in the application context.

Here's how it works:

1. **Scanning for Beans**: During the application startup, Spring scans all the classes in the specified packages to find beans.
 This is often done using annotations like `@ComponentScan` or `@SpringBootApplication`, which specify the base packages to scan.

2. **Creating Beans**: For each class found during the scanning process that is annotated with Spring stereotype annotations
 (e.g., `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.), Spring creates a corresponding bean instance and registers it within the application context.

3. **Transaction Annotations**: If a bean class is annotated with `@Transactional`, or if any of its methods are annotated with `@Transactional`,
 Spring takes note of it.

4. **Proxy Creation**: For each bean with transactional annotations, Spring creates a proxy around the actual bean.
This proxy will intercept method calls to the target bean and handle transaction management.

5. **Method Invocation**: Whenever a method is called on the transactional bean, the proxy intercepts the method call and applies the transactional
 behavior as per the configured transactional attributes.

So, when we say "For each bean," it means that Spring handles transaction management on a per-bean basis. Any method calls made to the
transactional beans will go through the proxy, allowing Spring to apply the appropriate transactional behavior to each method based
on the specified attributes.

This approach allows you to control transactions at a fine-grained level by annotating individual methods or classes that need transactional support.
 Spring will automatically manage the transactions for those specific beans and methods, while the rest of your application
 can remain transaction-agnostic, simplifying your codebase and improving maintainability.


 In Spring, beans can be created and managed in multiple ways, and `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` are just a few of the annotations used to define beans. These annotations are part of the Spring stereotype annotations, and they are commonly used to identify and register beans during component scanning.

 However, Spring provides various other mechanisms to define beans, and not all beans need to be annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, or `@Repository`. Here are some ways Spring can create beans:

 1. **Annotated Stereotypes**: As you mentioned, `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` are part of the stereotype annotations. When you use these annotations on a class, Spring recognizes it as a bean during component scanning and registers it in the application context.

 2. **@Bean Methods**: In Java configuration classes annotated with `@Configuration`, you can define methods annotated with `@Bean`. Each `@Bean`-annotated method returns an object, and Spring registers the return value as a bean.

    ```java
    @Configuration
    public class MyConfig {
        @Bean
        public MyBean myBean() {
            return new MyBean();
        }
    }
    ```

 3. **XML Configuration**: In older versions of Spring or when using XML-based configurations, you can define beans using `<bean>`
  elements in the XML file.

    ```xml
    <beans>
        <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean"/>
    </beans>
    ```

 4. **Automatic Configuration**: Spring Boot provides auto-configuration based on classpath dependencies. It automatically configures
  beans based on the presence of certain classes or dependencies.

 5. **Custom BeanPostProcessors**: Spring allows you to define custom `BeanPostProcessor` implementations.
  These post-processors can manipulate or modify beans during their creation.

 6. **Factory Beans**: You can create custom FactoryBeans to programmatically define the creation logic for beans.

 These are just some of the ways to create beans in Spring. The core principle is that Spring manages objects as beans within its IoC container,
  regardless of how those beans are defined. The main requirement is that the objects need to be registered with the container so that they
  can be managed and provided as dependencies when needed.
