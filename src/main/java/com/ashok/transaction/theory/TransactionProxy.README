When you use the `@EnableTransactionManagement` annotation in a Spring Boot application, Spring sets up a mechanism to intercept method calls to
 the annotated beans. This mechanism is based on AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) and dynamic proxies.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it happens:

1. **Application Startup**: When your Spring Boot application starts up, Spring scans all the classes in the application context to identify beans
 (components, services, repositories, etc.) that have been annotated with `@Transactional` or other transaction-related annotations.

2. **Proxy Creation**: For each bean that has transactional annotations, Spring creates a proxy around the actual bean.
 This proxy will be used to intercept method calls to the target bean.

3. **Method Invocation**: When a method is called on a bean with transactional annotations, the call is intercepted by the proxy
 instead of directly invoking the method on the target bean.

4. **Transaction Management**: The proxy checks the method's transactional metadata (such as `@Transactional` attributes) to determine whether
 a transaction should be started or whether the method should join an existing transaction.

5. **Transaction Handling**: Based on the transactional attributes, the proxy will start a new transaction or join an existing one.
If a transaction is started, the proxy will call the method on the actual target bean within the context of that transaction.

6. **Commit or Rollback**: After the method execution is complete, the proxy will commit the transaction if the method execution was successful
 (no exceptions were thrown). If an exception is thrown from the method, the proxy will roll back the transaction.

7. **Exception Handling**: If the method throws a checked exception, the proxy will check whether the exception should trigger a rollback
based on the `rollbackFor` and `noRollbackFor` attributes of the `@Transactional` annotation.

8. **Proxy Behavior**: The proxy ensures that all method calls adhere to the defined transactional behavior, such as isolation level,
 propagation rules, and rollback rules.

By using this proxy-based approach, Spring can provide transactional behavior to your beans without requiring you to handle transaction
 management explicitly in your code. This approach keeps the transactional concerns separate from your business logic, making
  your code more maintainable and easier to read.

It's essential to note that this proxy-based transaction management works for Spring-managed beans within the Spring container.
 If you have self-invocation of methods (calling a method from within the same class),
  transactional behavior might not be applied as Spring cannot intercept self-invocations using dynamic proxies. In such cases,
  you can refactor your code or use AspectJ-based transaction management to address this limitation.


  Certainly! When you use Spring's `@EnableTransactionManagement` or apply the `@Transactional` annotation to a method or class, Spring will create a proxy that intercepts the method calls to add transactional behavior. This mechanism is based on Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and dynamic proxies.

  Here's a more detailed explanation of how this works:

  1. **AOP and Dynamic Proxies**: Aspect-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transaction management,
   from your core business logic. In the context of transaction management, AOP enables Spring to inject transactional behavior into your methods
    without directly modifying your code. Dynamic proxies are a way to achieve this at runtime.

  2. **Bean Definition**: When you annotate a class or method with `@Transactional`, you are providing metadata to Spring that indicates this
  method or class should be transactional.

  3. **Proxy Creation**: Spring will create a proxy around the target class (or the class containing the transactional method).
  The proxy will have the same interface as the target class, which means it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original object.

  4. **Method Invocation**: When a method is called on the target class (or its proxy), the call will be intercepted by the proxy.

  5. **Transaction Management**: The proxy checks the transactional metadata (transactional attributes) associated with the method being called.
   These attributes define the behavior of the transaction, such as the propagation behavior, isolation level, and whether the method
    should trigger a rollback on specific exceptions.

  6. **Transaction Handling**: Based on the transactional attributes, the proxy will decide whether to start a new transaction or join an
   existing one. If a transaction is started, the proxy will invoke the method on the actual target object within the context of that transaction.

  7. **Commit or Rollback**: After the method execution is complete, the proxy will commit the transaction if the method execution was successful
  (no exceptions were thrown). If an exception is thrown from the method, the proxy will roll back the transaction based on the configured rollback rules.

  8. **Proxy Behavior**: The proxy ensures that all method calls adhere to the defined transactional behavior, such as isolation level,
   propagation rules, and rollback rules. The transactional behavior is added to the method call transparently, without you needing to
    manually handle transaction management in your code.

  By using this proxy-based approach, Spring enables you to add transactional behavior to your methods without coupling them directly with
  transaction management code. It promotes separation of concerns and allows you to focus on your business logic, while Spring takes care of
   managing transactions for you.
