In Spring, the default propagation behavior of a transaction is `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED`. This means that if a method is executed within an
 existing transactional context, it will participate in that transaction. If there is no active transaction when the method is called,
  a new transaction will be created for the method.

To understand this better, let's look at the different propagation behaviors available and the default behavior:

1. **PROPAGATION_REQUIRED (Default)**:
   - If a transactional method is called from within an existing transactional context, it will join the ongoing transaction.
   - If there is no active transaction when the method is called, a new transaction will be created for that method.

2. **PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW**:
   - A new transaction will always be started for the method, regardless of whether there is an ongoing transaction or not.
   - The ongoing transaction (if any) will be suspended while the method's transaction is active.

3. **PROPAGATION_NESTED**:
   - A nested transaction is started if there is an ongoing transaction.
   - The nested transaction behaves like a savepoint within the existing transaction. If the nested transaction fails,
   it will only rollback to the savepoint, not affecting the outer transaction.
   - If there is no active transaction when the method is called, a new transaction will be started, similar to `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED`.

4. **PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS**:
   - The method does not require a transactional context to be executed.
   - If there is an ongoing transaction, the method will participate in that transaction. Otherwise, it will be executed without a transaction.

5. **PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED**:
   - The method will be executed without a transactional context.
   - If there is an ongoing transaction, it will be suspended while the method is executed.

6. **PROPAGATION_MANDATORY**:
   - The method must be executed within an active transactional context; otherwise, it will throw an exception.

7. **PROPAGATION_NEVER**:
   - The method must not be executed within an active transactional context; otherwise, it will throw an exception.

8. **PROPAGATION_REQUIRED, READ_ONLY**:
   - Similar to `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED`, but indicates that the transaction will be read-only, and any attempt to modify the data will result
   in an exception.

Remember that the default propagation behavior can vary depending on the transaction manager and platform you are using, but in most cases,
 `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` is the default choice. It's crucial to understand the different propagation behaviors and choose the appropriate one
  based on your specific use case to ensure proper transactional behavior in your application.
